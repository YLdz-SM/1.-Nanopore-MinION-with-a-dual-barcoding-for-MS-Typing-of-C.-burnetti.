# Introduction
Coxiella burnetii, also known as the causal agent of Q fever, is a zoonotic pathogen infecting 15 humans and several animal species. Here, we investigated the epidemiological context of C. burnetii 16 from an area in the Hérault department in southern France, using the One Health paradigm. Multi-spacer typing based on dual barcoding nanopore sequencing highlighted the occur- 23 rence of new genotype of C. burnetii.
